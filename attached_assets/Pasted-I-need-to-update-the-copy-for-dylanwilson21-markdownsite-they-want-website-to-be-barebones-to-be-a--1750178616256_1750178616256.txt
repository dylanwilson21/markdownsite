please gather as much relevant information as possible for the copy to be good. They want to have Lana be a stand alone product and the main thing they want to highlight on their website is their core banking software which is Bria, Cala, and stable sats, but they are going to be advertising it as one white glove product. more info can be found about their prodcuts at @GaloyMoney/stablesats-rs @GaloyMoney/bria @GaloyMoney/cala @GaloyMoney/lana-bank https://github.com/GaloyMoney. rewrite the copy and also add anything that you should be added (along with button redirects, new pages etc) it should be formatted cleanly, and i want it to be optimized for both seo and geo . if you suggest new pages, redirects ets, give me those page too, all pages should be markdown
