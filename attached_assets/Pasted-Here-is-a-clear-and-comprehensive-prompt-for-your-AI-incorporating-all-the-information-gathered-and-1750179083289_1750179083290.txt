Here is a clear and comprehensive prompt for your AI, incorporating all the information gathered and your specific requests. This prompt is designed to generate the markdown files for your website, optimized for SEO and user experience.

AI Prompt:

Objective: Generate markdown files for the new Galoy website copy.

Target Audience:

Fintech startups and companies, especially those who have recently acquired or are in the process of acquiring a banking charter.

Existing banks looking to modernize their infrastructure and offer new, innovative financial products.

Key Differentiator & Core Message: Galoy provides a barebones, simple, and easy-to-use banking software solution that allows new fintechs and banks to get up and running quickly. The software is future-proofed and built on a modern, secure, and scalable architecture. While built on Bitcoin, the core banking suite can operate entirely in fiat, so the copy for the core suite should not focus heavily on "Bitcoin" or "crypto/DeFi," but rather on the underlying benefits of the technology (security, speed, low cost).

Products:

Lana (Standalone Product): A Bitcoin-backed lending platform.

Core Banking Suite (White-glove, all-in-one product):

Bria: Bitcoin Payments Hub

Cala: Core Accounting Ledger

Stablesats: Synthetic USD Hedging Engine
